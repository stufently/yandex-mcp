# Yandex Keyword Research

Research keywords and search trends for Russian and CIS markets using Yandex tools.

## Available Tools

- `mcp__yandex-wordstat__dynamics` - Analyze search volume trends over time (costs 2 quota units)
- `mcp__yandex-wordstat__regions` - See regional distribution of search interest (costs 2 quota units)
- `mcp__yandex-wordstat__get-regions-tree` - Get region hierarchy for filtering (free)
- `mcp__yandex-search__search` - See what currently ranks in Yandex for the keyword
- `mcp__yandex-webmaster__get-popular-queries` - Check if user's site ranks for terms (requires Webmaster access)

## Workflow

1. **Get popular queries**: Start with `top-requests` to find related searches and volumes
2. **Analyze trends**: Use `dynamics` to see if interest is growing or declining
3. **Regional breakdown**: Use `regions` to find which areas have highest interest
4. **SERP analysis** (optional): Use `search` to see current ranking content
5. **Own site check** (if Webmaster configured): Check user's site performance for these terms

## Output Guidelines

- Adapt output language to match the user's language
- Present search volumes with context (high/medium/low for the market)
- Highlight trend direction (growing, stable, declining) with percentage change
- Show top 5-10 regions by volume and by affinity index
- Include actionable insights based on the data
