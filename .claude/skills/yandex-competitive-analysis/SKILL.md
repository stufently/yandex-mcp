# Yandex Competitive Analysis

Analyze competitors and find opportunities in Russian and CIS search markets.

## Available Tools

- `mcp__yandex-search__search` - Find who currently ranks for target keywords
- `mcp__yandex-wordstat__top-requests` - Understand search volume and related queries
- `mcp__yandex-wordstat__dynamics` - Track if competition is increasing over time
- `mcp__yandex-wordstat__regions` - Find underserved regional markets
- `mcp__yandex-webmaster__get-popular-queries` - Compare user's site performance (requires Webmaster)
- `mcp__yandex-webmaster__get-summary` - Get user's site health metrics (requires Webmaster)

## Workflow

1. **Search landscape**: Use `search` to find top 10-20 results for target keywords
2. **Volume analysis**: Use `top-requests` to understand search demand
3. **Trend analysis**: Use `dynamics` to see if market is growing
4. **Regional opportunities**: Use `regions` to find high-affinity, underserved regions
5. **Own position** (if Webmaster): Compare user's ranking vs competitors

## Analysis Framework

When analyzing competitors:
- **Domain authority signals**: Identify recurring domains in top positions
- **Content patterns**: Note content types that rank (articles, products, forums)
- **Gap opportunities**: Keywords with high volume but weak competition
- **Regional gaps**: Regions with high affinity but low competition

## Output Guidelines

- Adapt output language to match the user's language
- Present competitor domains with their ranking positions
- Highlight content gaps and opportunities clearly
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Include regional opportunities if relevant
